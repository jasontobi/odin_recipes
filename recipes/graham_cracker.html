    <h2>Description</h2>

    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
        </ul>    
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and baking soda; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar and honey until light and fluffy. Stir in the sifted ingredients alternating with the milk and vanilla. Cover dough and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Divide the chilled dough into quarters. On a well floured surface, roll the dough out one quarter at a time into a 5x15 inch rectangle. Divide into rectangles using a knife. Place rectangles into ungreased cookie sheets. Mark a line down the center of each one, and prick with a fork. For a cinnamon flavored cracker, sprinkle with a cinnamon sugar mixture before baking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
        </ol>
