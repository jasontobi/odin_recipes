    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon light corn syrup</li>
            <li>1 Â¼ cups water, divided</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>2 egg whites</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>    
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dust a 9x9 inch square dish generously with confectioners' sugar.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together white sugar, corn syrup and 3/4 cup water. Heat to 250 to 265 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.</li>
            <li>While syrup is heating, place remaining water in a metal bowl and sprinkle gelatin over the surface. Place bowl over simmering water until gelatin has dissolved completely. Keep in a warm place until syrup has come to temperature. Remove syrup from heat and whisk gelatin mixture into hot syrup. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip egg whites to soft peaks. Continue to beat, pouring syrup mixture into egg whites in a thin stream, until the egg whites are very stiff. Stir in vanilla. Spread evenly in prepared pan and let rest 8 hours or overnight before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
